StatsAgg 1.5
 * Document 'Alerts Report'
 * Document API
 * Update screenshots of 'suspensions' 
 * Finish/refine API
   * Triggered metrics for an alert
   * Regex tester
   * Acknowledge alert 
 * Expose "number of datapoints in memory" (home page)
 * Hide 'Suspend Notification Only?' with javascript when doing a 'metric suspension'
 * Alert details -- say "associated with these suspensions..."
 * Notification details -- say "associated with these alerts..."

StatsAgg 1.6
 * Alter buttons on 'details' pages (only when not hiding the navbar)
 * 'Last modified at' for alerts, suspensions, etc 
 * InfluxDB 0.9+ support
 * support output module configs that don't require the _n suffix
 * Support 'no timestamp' on Graphite metrics
 * Alert status output 'is suspended' tags for OpenTSDB & InfluxDB
 * "debug don't output" for output modules. Run output module logic without actually connecting to external dbs.
 * Fix issue with popover help buttons not displaying text after click-on-->click-off-->click-on
 * Make optional output HTTP error response bodies to log file
   
Medium term
 * Manual injection of metrics via a new servlet w/ a WebUI component
 * Multi-thread StatsD aggregation routine & Graphite aggregation routine
 * Apply column-sort to WebUI tables via parameter in URI
 * Control what StatsD 'timer' fields are outputted (so people can ignore the more useless ones)
 * Debug mode for "details" pages (include additional details)
 * Alternative output API for notification groups
 * Let the user control the number of metrics to return on 'Regex Tester' and 'Metric Group - Metric Key Associations' 
 * Advanced options
   * Cleanup metrics after... (currently hardcoded to 24hrs)
   * (optional) Incoming metric rate limits
   * (optional) Limit metric-key length displayed in StatsAgg WebUI
   * (optional) Limit metric group association count
   * (optional) Limit max # datapoints for in memory for a single metric-key
   
Long-term / Wishlist / Brainstorming
 * Notification groups that inherit other notification group properties
 * Support for KariosDB?
 * Reduce JS code for typeahead & update typeahead library?
   * Worth the time? This library is a huge pain.
 * StatsD forwarder
 * Support more forms of notification (not just email)
 * View application config in WebUI
   * Need to remove anything sensitive (smtp credentials, etc)
 * History/events log w/ UI component
 * Alert escalation notification-group in Alerts
 * APIs to create alerts / metric-groups / etc
 * "Event Listener" API -- for anything that wants to use StatsAgg to send an alert, but also wants to tie into 'Suspensions'
 * Mobile versions of essential WebUI pages
   * Make existing pages more mobile friendly?
 * Flot graphs on 'Recent Metric Values' page
   * Covered by Graphite/Grafana for visualization
 * OpenTSDB SSL for HTTP interface
   * Migrated by using other software as a middle-man. Ex-- HAProxy, AWS ELB.
 * Support Graphite Pickle format
   * Barely used by anything. Python specific.
 * Migrate connection pool to HikariCP
 * Server-side WebUI tables?
   * Will likely lose functionality
 * Calculator (add/multiply/etc) all the most recent values of a metric group)?
 * Alert by individual metric?
 * Convert to a regular Java app & use embedded Tomcat for the WebUI
   * Simplifies installation, but removes all the nice stuff we get from Tomcat.
   * Would need to be a separate git repo
